What is Lung Cancer? Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. It is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Lung cancer typically starts in the cells lining the air passages of the lungs. Over time, the cancer cells can form tumors and interfere with the normal functioning of the lungs, including the ability to breathe.

Types of Lung Cancer: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): This is the most common type, accounting for about 80-85% of lung cancer cases. NSCLC includes several subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC): SCLC accounts for about 10-15% of lung cancer cases. It tends to grow and spread more quickly than NSCLC and is often associated with a history of smoking. Causes and Risk Factors: Smoking: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. The risk of developing lung cancer increases with the duration and intensity of smoking. Secondhand Smoke: Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases the risk of lung cancer. Occupational Exposure: Certain occupations, such as mining, construction, and asbestos removal, may expose individuals to carcinogenic substances that increase the risk of lung cancer. Air Pollution: Prolonged exposure to air pollutants, such as radon gas and industrial emissions, may contribute to the development of lung cancer. Family History: A family history of lung cancer may increase an individual's risk of developing the disease. Symptoms: Persistent cough Chest pain Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Hoarseness Unexplained weight loss Fatigue Recurrent respiratory infections Diagnosis: Imaging Tests: Chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or PET scan may be used to visualize abnormalities in the lungs. Biopsy: A tissue sample is collected from the lungs for examination under a microscope to confirm the presence of cancer cells and determine the type of lung cancer. Treatment: Treatment options for lung cancer depend on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health. They may include:

Surgery Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Immunotherapy Prognosis: The prognosis for lung cancer varies widely depending on factors such as the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the type of lung cancer, and the individual's overall health. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve prognosis and increase survival rates.

Prevention: Avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. Minimize exposure to environmental carcinogens. Follow workplace safety guidelines. Consider regular screenings for individuals at high risk, such as current or former smokers. ML ALGORTHIMS USED Random Forest: Define what a random forest is: A machine learning ensemble method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training. Explain the intuition behind random forest: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features. Discuss the advantages of random forest: Handles high-dimensional data, avoids overfitting, provides feature importance, etc. Provide a code snippet demonstrating how to implement random forest for lung cancer prediction. Linear Regression: Define linear regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Explain the assumptions of linear regression: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals. Discuss when linear regression is appropriate: Predicting continuous outcomes, understanding relationships between variables, etc. Provide a code snippet demonstrating how to implement linear regression for lung cancer prediction. Logistic Regression: Define logistic regression: A statistical method used for binary classification, where the output is a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class. Explain the logistic function: Sigmoid function that maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1. Discuss the advantages of logistic regression: Interpretable coefficients, works well with linearly separable data, provides probabilities, etc. Provide a code snippet demonstrating how to implement logistic regression for lung cancer prediction.
